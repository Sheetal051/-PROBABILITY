Q:X attempts 94 questions and gets 141 marks. If for every correct answer 4 marks is given, and for every wrong answer 1 mark is deducted, then the number of questions wrongly answered by X is __.
A.45
B.47
C.57
D.40
Ans:
To determine the number of questions X answered incorrectly, let's set up the problem with the following variables:

Let c represent the number of correct answers.
Let w represent the number of wrong answers.
We know the following:

c+w=94 (total number of questions attempted)
4c−w=141 (total marks, where 4 marks are given for each correct answer and 1 mark is deducted for each wrong answer)

We have the system of equations:
c+w=94
4c−w=141
​
To solve this system, we can add the two equations together:

(c+w)+(4c−w)=94+141
5c=235
c=47

Now, substitute c=47 back into the first equation to find w:

47+w=94
w=94−47
w=47

Thus, the number of questions wrongly answered by X is: 47
