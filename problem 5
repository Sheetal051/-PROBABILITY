Q: I select three numbers randomly from 1 to 10. What is the probability that their product is an odd number?
a.1/12
b.1/2
c.3/4
d.11/12
Ans:
Let's analyze the situation:
For the product to be odd, all three numbers must be odd.
There are 5 odd numbers from 1 to 10: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
The probability of selecting an odd number in the first draw is 5/10.
The probability of selecting an odd number in the second draw (given that the first number is odd) is 4/9, since there are 4 remaining odd numbers out of 9 remaining numbers.
The probability of selecting an odd number in the third draw (given that the first two numbers are odd) is 3/8, since there are 3 remaining odd numbers out of 8 remaining numbers.

Now, we can find the probability that the product is an odd number by multiplying the probabilities of each draw:

P(Product is odd) = (5/10) × (4/9) × (3/8) = 3/12 = 1/4

However, we need to consider the fact that the order of selection doesn't matter. We can select the three odd numbers in 3! = 6 ways, but we've counted each combination 6 times in our previous calculation. So, we need to divide the result by 6:

P(Product is odd) = (1/4) / 6 = 1/24

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

P(Product is odd) = 1/24 = 1/(2 × 12) = 1/12

And surprisingly, option A is the correct answer:

a. 1/12
