Q:There are 6 oranges, 2 pink, 4 yellow and 3 green towels in a carton. What is the probability of picking up 2 orange towels randomly?
a.1/7
b.2/15
c.2/7
d.6/15
Ans:
Here are the steps to find the probability of picking up 2 orange towels randomly:

Step 1: Identify the total number of towels

There are 6 oranges, 2 pink, 4 yellow, and 3 green towels in the carton. Let's add them up to find the total number of towels:

6 (orange) + 2 (pink) + 4 (yellow) + 3 (green) = 15

So, there are 15 towels in total.

Step 2: Identify the number of orange towels

There are 6 orange towels.

Step 3: Find the probability of picking one orange towel

The probability of picking one orange towel is the number of orange towels divided by the total number of towels:

P(one orange) = Number of orange towels / Total number of towels = 6 / 15 = 2/5

Step 4: Find the probability of picking another orange towel (given that one orange towel has already been picked)

If one orange towel has already been picked, there are now 5 orange towels left out of a total of 14 towels (since one towel has already been removed).

The probability of picking another orange towel is:

P(another orange | one orange already picked) = Number of remaining orange towels / Total number of remaining towels = 5 / 14

Step 5: Find the probability of picking 2 orange towels

The probability of picking 2 orange towels is the product of the probabilities of picking one orange towel and then picking another orange towel:

P(two orange) = P(one orange) × P(another orange | one orange already picked) = (2/5) × (5/14) = 1/7

Therefore, the probability of picking up 2 orange towels randomly is:

a. 1/7
