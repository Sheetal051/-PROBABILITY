Q:  If 10 letters are to be placed in 10 addressed envelopes, then what is the probability that at least one letter is placed in wrong addressed envelope?
a.1/10!    
b.1/9!     
c.1- (1/10!)           
d.9/10
Ans:
This is a classic problem of derangements. A derangement is a permutation of the letters such that no letter is in its correct envelope.

Let's count the number of ways to place the letters in the envelopes such that at least one letter is in the wrong envelope:

Total number of ways to place the letters in the envelopes: 10! (since there are 10 choices for the first letter, 9 for the second, and so on)
Number of ways to place the letters in the correct envelopes: 1 (only one way to put each letter in its correct envelope)

Number of ways to place the letters in the envelopes such that at least one letter is in the wrong envelope: 10! - 1 (since we subtract the one correct arrangement from the total number of arrangements)
Now, we can find the probability that at least one letter is placed in the wrong envelope:

P(At least one letter in wrong envelope) = Number of derangements / Total number of arrangements = (10! - 1) / 10!

Simplifying the fraction, we get:
P(At least one letter in wrong envelope) = 1 - 1/10!

So, the correct answer is:

c. 1 - (1/10!)
