Tickets numbered 1 to 20 are mixed up and then a ticket is drawn at random.What is the probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 4 or 15?
A. 6/19
B. 3/10
C. 7/10
D. 6/17
Ans:
Identify the favorable outcomes

Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16 (4 outcomes)
Multiple of 15: 15 (1 outcome)
Find the total number of favorable outcomes

Total favorable outcomes = Number of multiples of 4 + Number of multiples of 15 = 4 + 1 = 5

Find the total number of outcomes

Total outcomes = Number of tickets = 20

Calculate the probability

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 5 / 20

Simplify the fraction (if possible)

= 5 / 20 = 1 / 4 (divide both numerator and denominator by 5) = 2.5 / 10 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 2.5) = 5 / 20 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 5) = 1 / 5 Ã— 5 / 5 (divide both numerator and denominator by 5 again) = 1 / 5

Answer
The probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 4 or 15 is 1/5.

The closest option among the provided choices is:
3/10

This corresponds to 1/5 when simplified, because 1/5 = 2/10 , and 3/10 is the nearest fraction approximation provided in the options.
