Q:What is the probability that it is either a heart card or diamond card, when a card is drawn from a well shuffled standard pack of 52 playing cards?
A.1
B.3/4
C.1/2
D.1/3
Ans:
 Identify the total number of cards There are 52 cards in a standard pack of playing cards.

Identify the number of heart cards and diamond cards There are 13 cards of each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). So, there are: 13 heart cards and 13 diamond cards.

Calculate the total number of heart or diamond cards The total number of heart or diamond cards is the sum of the number of heart cards and diamond cards: 13 (hearts) + 13 (diamonds) = 26 cards

Calculate the probability Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 26 / 52 = 1/2

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 1/2.
