Q:In a single throw with 2 dices, what is probability of neither getting an even number on one and nor a multiple of 3 on other?
A.11/36
B.25/36
C.5/6
D.1/6
Ans:
To determine the probability of neither getting an even number on one die nor a multiple of 3 on the other in a single throw with two dice, we need to calculate the complement of the event that at least one die shows an even number or a multiple of 3.
Step-by-Step Solution
Identify the possible outcomes for each die:

Each die has the numbers: 
1,2,3,4,5,6.

Determine the outcomes to avoid:
Even numbers: 
2,4,6.
Multiples of 3: 
3,6.

Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes:
The numbers that are neither even nor multiples of 3:1 and 5.

Determine the probability of favorable outcomes on each die:
For one die, the favorable outcomes are 1 and 5.

Thus, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6.

Calculate the combined probability for both dice:
Probability of a die showing 1 or 5 is 2/6 = 1/3

Since the events for the two dice are independent:

P(neither even nor multiple of 3 on both dice)= (1/3) * (1/3)= 1/9

Therefore, the correct probability is: 1/9
