Q: Two cards are drawn at random from a pack of cards. The probability that both  are queens or diamonds is:
a.20/221    
b.15/221    
c.13/221    
d.14/221
Ans:
The probability of drawing a queen or a diamond on the first draw is:

P(Q or D) = P(Q) + P(D) - P(Q and D)

where P(Q) is the probability of drawing a queen, P(D) is the probability of drawing a diamond, and P(Q and D) is the probability of drawing the queen of diamonds.

P(Q) = 4/52, P(D) = 13/52, and P(Q and D) = 1/52 (since there's only one queen of diamonds).

So, P(Q or D) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52.

Now, the probability that both cards are queens or diamonds is:

P((Q or D) and (Q or D)) = P(Q or D) × P(Q or D)

However, since we've already drawn one card, the probability of drawing a queen or a diamond on the second draw should be calculated as:

P(Q or D | Q or D) = (3/51) + (12/51) = 15/51

So, the probability that both cards are queens or diamonds is:

P((Q or D) and (Q or D)) = (16/52) × (15/51)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P((Q or D) and (Q or D)) = 240/2652 = 15/221

Therefore, the correct answer is:

b. 15/221
